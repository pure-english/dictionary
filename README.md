# Pure English Dictionary

## TODO

- [x] Fix duplicates of search due to second Anglish spellings
- [x] Fix duplicated search results due to search not clearing on update
- [ ] Fix mark tags not working on Anglish word definitions (I think)
- [x] Fix "No results found" showing up even when results are found via fuzzy
  search
- [ ] Fix when search results find a word, but don't include the sense that is
  highlighted, meaning it shows an unrelated entry. Like "to destroy" in
  "fell".
- [ ] Fix loading searches from URL not searching "Other Results" nor
  highlighting them
